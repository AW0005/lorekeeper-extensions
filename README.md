# Lorekeeper

Lorekeeper is a framework for managing deviantART-based ARPGs/closed species masterlists coded using the Laravel framework. In simple terms - you will be able to make a copy of the site, do some minor setup/enter data about your species and game, and it'll provide you with the automation to keep track of your species, players and ARPG submissions.

# Info

This is one of several branches I maintain for sharing modifications or projects I've made. For my general fixes branch, see master.

# Sep-Prompts

This moves prompts out of the "world" section of the site and into their own section. The reasons for doing this were twofold:
- Their original location, while servicable, is somewhat awkward
- With prompts moved into their own section of the site, this allows space to build out a sidebar that better details the range of activities they cover. 
- For instance, sidebar links may each point to a list of prompts contained in a certain category-- for example, one for utilities, one for events, ones for different kinds of activities-- the list goes on.

You could also certainly do something interesting with the index page as well... It's left largely a blank slate modeled after the world section's index page.

In short, it's mostly useful if you're doing a whole lot with the prompts system and would benefit from more organization around it.
